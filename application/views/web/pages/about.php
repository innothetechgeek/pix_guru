	                        <div class="text">There are such a lot of aspects why I enjoyed the photography training, tours and group outings.  We had lots of opportunities to practical apply the knowledge we gained and received advice and feedback on our attempts all the time.   With the tours we visited places which I would never have been able to visit on my own and had the most unique experiences – such as the cheetahs running away with a camera bag!  The interaction and feedback happens in a very relaxed manner and always in such a positive way that you feel good about our efforts and are motivated to try even harder.  Something that I struggled with to photograph – water - is easy now and I have also realized how wonderful complex nature is when you look through a macro lens at the small things in nature.  My love for photography – people, nature, whatever – have reached heights that would not have been possible without the assistance and feedback I received from Ohna over the last 11 years. </div>

	                        <div class="text">I loved every aspect of the photography course I did with Ohna. I am totally technologically challenged, but she was very patient and kept on repeating and assisting me and with her positive feedback I grew to absolutely love photography.  
							The only thing that kept me away from the tours she arranged, were financials and not having enough leave – but the times I went with, it was absolutely AWESOME – and then after every day out, we received full feedback and recommendations on the photos we took during the day.  This enabled us to try the new knowledge the next day.

	                    <div class="testimonial">
	                        <div class="text">I started one of Ohna's Beginners Photography course when I was in High School. I just wanted to do something creative and it ended up with me still learning something new from her after 9 years. At that time I enjoyed taking pictures in my own way, but did not have the knowledge and skills to take it further and create a striking photo. 

							I ended up completing her Beginner's- and Advanced Photography courses as well as  Photoshop. What really stood out for me was the quality of the teachings as well as the positive feedback and criticism she gave us. We did a lot of practicals in order to apply what we learned. It consisted of an extremely wide variety of photography genre's from wild life to night photography, macro, portraits and anything else you can think of. It was a wonderful platform to develop your creativity. <br><br>

							We also had wonderful excursions to Nieuwoudtville, various game farms and many more. Ohna gave constructive criticism during practicals which helped me develop new skills and learn from my mistakes. My photos were creative when I started but it lacked skill and through workshops, teachings and classes I developed my own unique photography style.  She is at the moment assisting me to start my own photography business.

                                Ohna’s courses covers all aspects of photography step by step which ensures maximum understanding for the beginner through to the more advanced photographer. Her classes are well prepared and organised and she uses appropriate videos to enhance learning material. She also uses a  good mix of theory and practical sessions making it easy to learn new skills.
                                She offers advice on photographic kit too and follows up with links to useful websites.
                                I went on 4 photography tours with Ohna. It was well planned and organised. Maximum photographing opertunities and loads of fun. She took us to places where very few people had the priviledge to visit. These tours will always be some of the most memorable highlites of my life.
                                <br><br>She also organises free outings on a regular basis and we visit some of the most scenic and interesting places. During these outings students can practise their newly learned skills and she will assist with free photography tips and instruction. Ohna goes the extra mile and will always offers more than you paid for.
                                The friendships and bonding amongst her and her students are amazing and worth more than few therapeutic psychology sessions.
