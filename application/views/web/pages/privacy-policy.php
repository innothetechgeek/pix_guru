    			<br>

				<p>
					We’re delighted that you’ve shown interest in our enterprise. Data protection is of a particularly high priority 
					for the management of Pix-Guru.com. The use of our website, Pix-guru.com, is possible without any indication of 
					Personal Data; however, if a Data Subject wants to use certain services via our website, the processing of Personal 
					Data could become necessary. If the processing of Personal Data is necessary and there’s no statutory basis for such 
					processing, we generally obtain consent from the Data Subject.
				</p>
				<p>
                    The processing of Personal Data, such as the name, address, e-mail address, or telephone number of a Data Subject 
                    shall always be in line with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), and in accordance with the country-specific 
                    data protection regulations applicable to Pix-Guru.com. By means of this data protection declaration, our enterprise 
                    would like to inform the general public of the nature, scope, and purpose of the Personal Data we collect, use and 
                    process. Furthermore, Data Subjects are informed, by means of this data protection declaration, of the rights to which they are entitled.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As the Controller, Pix-Guru.com has implemented numerous technical and organizational measures to ensure the most complete 
                    protection of Personal Data processed through this website. However, Internet-based data transmissions may in principle have security gaps, 
                    so absolute protection may not be guaranteed. For this reason, every Data Subject is free to transfer Personal Data to us 
                    via alternative means, e.g. by telephone.
                </p>

    			<br>
    			<p>
    			    The data protection declaration of Pix-Guru.com is based on the terms used by the European legislator for the adoption of the 
        			General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Our data protection declaration should be legible and understandable for the general 
        			public, as well as our customers and business partners. To ensure this, we would like to first explain the terminology used.
        		</p>
        		<p>
                    In this data protection declaration, we use, inter alia, the following terms:
                </p>
                <h5>
                    a) Personal Data
                </h5>
                <p>
                    Personal Data means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (“Data Subject”). An identifiable 
                    natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, 
                    an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, 
                    genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person.
                </p>
                <h5>
                    b) Data Subject
                </h5>
                <p>
                    A Data Subject is any identified or identifiable natural person, whose Personal Data is processed by the Controller responsible for the processing.
                </p>
                <h5>
                    c) Processing
                </h5>
                <p>
                    Processing is any operation or set of operations which is performed on Personal Data or on sets of Personal Data, whether or not 
                    by automated means, such as collection, recording, organisation, structuring, storage, adaptation or alteration, retrieval, 
                    consultation, use, disclosure by transmission, dissemination or otherwise making available, alignment or combination, restriction, erasure or destruction.
                </p>
                <h5>
                    d) Restriction of Processing
                </h5>
                <p>
                    Restriction of Processing is the marking of stored Personal Data with the aim of limiting their processing in the future.
                </p>
                <h5>
                    e) Profiling
                </h5>
                <p>
                    Profiling means any form of automated processing of Personal Data consisting of the use of Personal Data to evaluate certain personal 
                    aspects relating to a natural person, in particular to analyse or predict aspects concerning that natural person's performance at work, 
                    economic situation, health, personal preferences, interests, reliability, behaviour, location or movements.
                </p>
                <h5>
                    f) Pseudonymisation
                </h5>
                <p>
                    Pseudonymisation is the processing of Personal Data in such a manner that the Personal Data can no longer be attributed to a specific
                    Data Subject without the use of additional information, provided that such additional information is kept separately and is subject to 
                    technical and organisational measures to ensure that the Personal Data are not attributed to an identified or identifiable natural person.
                </p>
                <h5>
                    g) Controller or Controller Responsible for the Processing
                </h5>
                <p>
                    The Controller or Controller Responsible for the Processing is the natural or legal person, public authority, agency or other body which, 
                    alone or jointly with others, determines the purposes and means of the processing of Personal Data; where the purposes and means of such 
                    processing are determined by Union or Member State law, the Controller or the specific criteria for its nomination may be provided for 
                    by Union or Member State law.
                </p>
                <h5>
                    h) Processor
                </h5>
                <p>
                    The Processor is a natural or legal person, public authority, agency or other body which processes Personal Data on behalf of the Controller.
                </p>
                <h5>
                    i) Recipient
                </h5>
                <p>
                    The Recipient is a natural or legal person, public authority, agency or another body, to which the Personal Data are disclosed, whether 
                    a third party or not. However, public authorities which may receive Personal Data in the framework of a particular inquiry in accordance 
                    with Union or Member State law shall not be regarded as recipients; the processing of those data by those public authorities shall be in 
                    compliance with the applicable data protection rules according to the purposes of the processing.
                </p>
                <h5>
                    j) Third Party
                </h5>
                <p>
                    A Third Party is a natural or legal person, public authority, agency or body other than the Data Subject, Controller, processor 
                    and persons who, under the direct authority of the Controller or processor, are authorised to process Personal Data.
                </p>
                <h5>
                    k) Consent
                </h5>
                <p>
                    Consent of the Data Subject is any freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous indication of the Data Subject's wishes by which 
                    he or she, by a statement or by a clear affirmative action, signifies agreement to the processing of Personal Data relating to him or her.

                    The website operated by Pix-Guru.com uses cookies. Cookies are text files that are stored in a computer system via an Internet browser.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Many Internet sites and servers use cookies. Many cookies contain a so-called cookie ID. A cookie ID is a unique identifier of the cookie. 
                    It consists of a character string through which Internet pages and servers can be assigned to the specific Internet browser in which the 
                    cookie was stored. This allows visited Internet sites and servers to differentiate the individual browser of the Data Subject from other 
                    Internet browsers that contain other cookies. A specific Internet browser can be recognised and identified using the unique cookie ID.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Through the use of cookies, Pix-Guru.com can provide the users of this website with more user-friendly services that would not be possible without the cookie setting.

                <p>
                    By means of a cookie, the information and offers on our website can be optimised with the user in mind. Cookies allow us, as previously mentioned, 
                    to recognise our website users. The purpose of this recognition is to make it easier for users to utilise our website. The website user that uses 
                    cookies doesn’t have to enter access data each time the website is accessed because this function is taken over by the cookie, which is stored on 
                    the user's computer system. Another example is the cookie of a shopping cart in an online shop. The online store remembers the articles that a 
                    customer has placed in the virtual shopping cart via a cookie.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Data Subject may, at any time, prevent the setting of cookies through our website by means of a corresponding setting of the Internet 
                    browser used, and may thus permanently deny the setting of cookies. Furthermore, already set cookies may be deleted at any time via an 
                    Internet browser or other software programs. This is possible in all popular Internet browsers. If the Data Subject deactivates the 
                    setting of cookies in the Internet browser used, not all functions of our website may be entirely usable.

                    4:  Collection of General Data and Information
                </h3>
                <p>
                    The website of Pix-Guru.com collects a series of general data and information when a Data Subject or automated system calls up the website. 
                    This general data and information are stored in the server log files. Collected may be (1) the browser types and versions used, (2) 
                    the operating system used by the accessing system, (3) the website from which an accessing system reaches our website (so-called referrers), 
                    (4) the sub-websites, (5) the date and time of access to the Internet site, (6) an Internet protocol address (IP address), (7) the Internet 
                    service provider of the accessing system, and (8) any other similar data and information that may be used in the event of attacks on our 
                    information technology systems.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When using these general data and information, Pix-Guru.com does not draw any conclusions about the Data Subject. Rather, this information is needed 
                    to (1) deliver the content of our website correctly, (2) optimise the content of our website as well as its advertisement, (3) ensure the long-term 
                    viability of our information technology systems and website technology, and (4) provide law enforcement authorities with the information necessary 
                    for criminal prosecution in case of a cyber-attack. Therefore, Pix-Guru.com analyses anonymously collected data and information statistically, with 
                    the aim of increasing the data protection and data security of our enterprise, and to ensure an optimal level of protection for the Personal Data 
                    we process. The anonymous data of the server log files are stored separately from all Personal Data provided by a Data Subject.

                    5:  Registration on our Website
                </h3>
                <p>
                    The Data Subject has the possibility to register on the website of the Controller with the indication of Personal Data. Which Personal Data are 
                    transmitted to the Controller is determined by the respective input mask used for the registration. The Personal Data entered by the Data Subject 
                    are collected and stored exclusively for internal use by the Controller, and for his own purposes. The Controller may request transfer to one or 
                    more processors (e.g. a parcel service) that also uses Personal Data for an internal purpose which is attributable to the Controller.
                </p>
                <p>
                    By registering on the website of the Controller, the IP address—assigned by the Internet service provider (ISP) and used by the Data Subject—date, 
                    and time of the registration are also stored. The storage of this data takes place against the background that this is the only way to prevent the 
                    misuse of our services, and, if necessary, to make it possible to investigate committed offences. Insofar, the storage of this data is necessary to 
                    secure the Controller. This data is not passed on to third parties unless there is a statutory obligation to pass on the data, or if the transfer 
                    serves the aim of criminal prosecution.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The registration of the Data Subject, with the voluntary indication of Personal Data, is intended to enable the Controller to offer the Data 
                    Subject contents or services that may only be offered to registered users due to the nature of the matter in question. Registered persons are 
                    free to change the Personal Data specified during the registration at any time, or to have them completely deleted from the data stock of the Controller.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The data Controller shall, at any time, provide information upon request to each Data Subject as to what Personal Data are stored about the Data 
                    Subject. In addition, the data Controller shall correct or erase Personal Data at the request or indication of the Data Subject, insofar as there 
                    are no statutory storage obligations. A Data Protection Officer particularly designated in this data protection declaration, as well as the entirety 
                    of the Controller’s employees are available to the Data Subject in this respect as contact persons.

                </h3>
                <p>
                    On the Pix-Guru.com website, users will in future be given the opportunity to subscribe to our enterprise's newsletter. 
                    The input mask used for this purpose determines what Personal Data are transmitted, as well as when the newsletter is ordered from the Controller.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Pix-Guru.com informs its customers and business partners regularly by means of a newsletter about enterprise offers. The enterprise's 
                    newsletter may only be received by the Data Subject if (1) the Data Subject has a valid e-mail address and (2) the Data Subject registers 
                    for the newsletter shipping.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A confirmation e-mail will be sent to the e-mail address registered by a Data Subject for the first time for newsletter shipping, for legal reasons, 
                    in the double opt-in procedure. This confirmation e-mail is used to prove whether the owner of the e-mail address as the Data Subject is authorised 
                    to receive the newsletter.
                </p>
                <p>
                    During the registration for the newsletter, we also store the IP address of the computer system assigned by the Internet service provider (ISP) 
                    and used by the Data Subject at the time of the registration, as well as the date and time of the registration. The collection of this data is 
                    necessary in order to understand the (possible) misuse of the e-mail address of a Data Subject at a later date, and it therefore serves the aim 
                    of the legal protection of the Controller.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Personal Data collected as part of a registration for the newsletter will only be used to send our newsletter. In addition, subscribers 
                    to the newsletter may be informed by e-mail, as long as this is necessary for the operation of the newsletter service or a registration in 
                    question, as this could be the case in the event of modifications to the newsletter offer, or in the event of a change in technical circumstances. 
                    There will be no transfer of Personal Data collected by the newsletter service to third parties.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The subscription to our newsletter may be terminated by the Data Subject at any time. The consent to the storage of Personal Data, which the Data 
                    Subject has given for shipping the newsletter, may be revoked at any time. For the purpose of revocation of consent, a corresponding link is found 
                    in each newsletter. It is also possible to unsubscribe from the newsletter at any time directly on the website of the Controller, or to communicate 
                    this to the Controller in a different way.

                    The future newsletter of Pix-Guru.com will contains so-called tracking pixels. A tracking pixel is a miniature graphic embedded in such e-mails, 
                    which are sent in HTML format to enable log file recording and analysis. This allows a statistical analysis of the success or failure of online 
                    marketing campaigns. Based on the embedded tracking pixel, Pix-Guru.com may see if and when an e-mail was opened by a Data Subject, and which 
                    links in the e-mail were called up by Data Subjects.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Such Personal Data collected in the tracking pixels contained in the newsletters are stored and analysed by the Controller in order to optimise 
                    the shipping of the newsletter, as well as to adapt the content of future newsletters even better to the interests of the Data Subject. These 
                    Personal Data will not be passed on to third parties. Data Subjects are at any time entitled to revoke the respective separate declaration of 
                    consent issued by means of the double-opt-in procedure. After a revocation, these Personal Data will be deleted by the Controller. Pix-Guru.com 
                    automatically regards a withdrawal from the receipt of the newsletter as a revocation.

                <p>
                    Pix-Guru.com plan to introduce a blog in future – this blog will offer users the possibility to leave individual comments on individual blog contributions 
                    on a blog, which is on the website of the Controller. A blog is a web-based, publicly-accessible portal, through which one or more people called bloggers 
                    or web-bloggers may post articles or write down thoughts in so-called blog posts. Blog posts may usually be commented by third parties.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If a Data Subject leaves a comment on the blog published on this website, the comments made by the Data Subject are also stored and published, as well 
                    as information on the date of the commentary and on the user's (pseudonym) chosen by the Data Subject. In addition, the IP address assigned by the Internet 
                    service provider (ISP) to the Data Subject is also logged. This storage of the IP address takes place for security reasons, and in case the Data Subject 
                    violates the rights of third parties or posts illegal content through a given comment. The storage of these Personal Data is, therefore, in the own interest 
                    of the data Controller, so that he can exculpate in the event of an infringement. This collected Personal Data will not be passed to third parties, unless 
                    such a transfer is required by law or serves the aim of the defence of the data Controller.

                    The data Controller shall collect and process the Personal Data of applicants for the purpose of the processing of the application

                    A social network is a place for social meetings on the Internet, an online community, which usually allows users to communicate with each 
                    other and interact in a virtual space. A social network may serve as a platform for the exchange of opinions and experiences or enable the 
                    Internet community to provide personal or business-related information. Facebook allows social network users to include the creation of 
                    private profiles, upload photos, and network through friend requests.

                <p>
                    With each call-up to one of the individual pages of this Internet website, which is operated by the Controller and into which a 
                    Facebook component (Facebook plug-ins) was integrated, the web browser on the information technology system of the Data Subject 
                    is automatically prompted to download display of the corresponding Facebook component from Facebook through the Facebook component. 
                    An overview of all the Facebook Plug-ins may be accessed under 
                    <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/plugins/" target="blank">https://developers.facebook.com/docs/plugins/</a>. During the course of 
                    this technical procedure, Facebook is made aware of what specific sub-site of our website was visited by the Data Subject.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If the Data Subject is logged in at the same time on Facebook, Facebook detects with every call-up to our website by the Data 
                    Subject—and for the entire duration of their stay on our Internet site—which specific sub-site of our Internet page was visited 
                    by the Data Subject. This information is collected through the Facebook component and associated with the respective Facebook 
                    account of the Data Subject. If the Data Subject clicks on one of the Facebook buttons integrated into our website, e.g. the 
                    "Like" button, or if the Data Subject submits a comment, then Facebook matches this information with the personal Facebook 
                    user account of the Data Subject and stores the Personal Data.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Facebook always receives, through the Facebook component, information about a visit to our website by the Data Subject, whenever 
                    the Data Subject is logged in at the same time on Facebook during the time of the call-up to our website. This occurs regardless 
                    of whether the Data Subject clicks on the Facebook component or not. If such a transmission of information to Facebook is not 
                    desirable for the Data Subject, then he or she may prevent this by logging off from their Facebook account before a call-up to 
                    our website is made.

                    15:  Data Protection Provisions About the Application and Use of Google Analytics (with Anonymization Function)
                </h3>
                <p>
                    On this website, the Controller has integrated the component of Google Analytics (with the anonymizer function). Google Analytics is a 
                    web analytics service. Web analytics is the collection, gathering, and analysis of data about the behaviour of visitors to websites. A 
                    web analysis service collects, inter alia, data about the website from which a person has come (the so-called referrer), which sub-pages 
                    were visited, or how often and for what duration a sub-page was viewed. Web analytics are mainly used for the optimisation of a website 
                    and in order to carry out a cost-benefit analysis of Internet advertising.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The operator of the Google Analytics component is Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheatre Pkwy, Mountain View, CA 94043-1351, United States.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For the web analytics through Google Analytics the Controller uses the application "_gat. _anonymizeIp". By means of this application 
                    the IP address of the Internet connection of the Data Subject is abridged by Google and anonymized when accessing our websites from a 
                    Member State of the European Union or another Contracting State to the Agreement on the European Economic Area.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The purpose of the Google Analytics component is to analyse the traffic on our website. Google uses the collected data and 
                    information, inter alia, to evaluate the use of our website and to provide online reports, which show the activities on our 
                    websites, and to provide other services concerning the use of our Internet site for us.
                <p>
                    Google Analytics places a cookie on the information technology system of the Data Subject. The definition of cookies is 
                    explained above. With the setting of the cookie, Google is enabled to analyse the use of our website. With each call-up 
                    to one of the individual pages of this Internet site, which is operated by the Controller and into which a Google Analytics 
                    component was integrated, the Internet browser on the information technology system of the Data Subject will automatically 
                    submit data through the Google Analytics component for the purpose of online advertising and the settlement of commissions 
                    to Google. During the course of this technical procedure, the enterprise Google gains knowledge of personal information, 
                    such as the IP address of the Data Subject, which serves Google, inter alia, to understand the origin of visitors and clicks, 
                    and subsequently create commission settlements.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The cookie is used to store personal information, such as the access time, the location from which the access was made, and the 
                    frequency of visits of our website by the Data Subject. With each visit to our Internet site, such Personal Data, including the 
                    IP address of the Internet access used by the Data Subject, will be transmitted to Google in the United States of America. 
                    These Personal Data are stored by Google in the United States of America. Google may pass these Personal Data collected 
                    through the technical procedure to third parties.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Data Subject may, as stated above, prevent the setting of cookies through our website at any time by means of a 
                    corresponding adjustment of the web browser used and thus permanently deny the setting of cookies. Such an adjustment 
                    to the Internet browser used would also prevent Google Analytics from setting a cookie on the information technology 
                    system of the Data Subject. In addition, cookies already in use by Google Analytics may be deleted at any time via a 
                    web browser or other software programs.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In addition, the Data Subject has the possibility of objecting to a collection of data that are generated by Google Analytics, 
                    which is related to the use of this website, as well as the processing of this data by Google and the chance to preclude any such. 
                    For this purpose, the Data Subject must download a browser add-on under the link 
                    <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout" target="blank">https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout</a> and 
                    install it. This browser add-on tells Google Analytics through a JavaScript, that any data and information about the visits of 
                    Internet pages may not be transmitted to Google Analytics. The installation of the browser add-ons is considered an objection 
                    by Google. If the information technology system of the Data Subject is later deleted, formatted, or newly installed, then the 
                    Data Subject must reinstall the browser add-ons to disable Google Analytics. If the browser add-on was uninstalled by the Data 
                    Subject or any other person who is attributable to their sphere of competence, or is disabled, it is possible to execute the 
                    re-installation or reactivation of the browser add-ons.

                    16:  Data Protection Provisions About the Application and Use of Google Remarketing
                </h3>
                <p>
                    On this website, the Controller has integrated Google Remarketing services. Google Remarketing is a feature of Google 
                    AdWords, which allows an enterprise to display advertising to Internet users who have previously resided on the enterprise's 
                    Internet site. The integration of Google Remarketing therefore allows an enterprise to create user-based advertising and thus 
                    shows relevant advertisements to interested Internet users.
                </p>
                <p>
                The operating company of the Google Remarketing services is the Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheatre Pkwy, Mountain View, CA 94043-1351, United States.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The purpose of Google Remarketing is the insertion of interest-relevant advertising. Google Remarketing allows us to display ads 
                    on the Google network or on other websites, which are based on individual needs and matched to the interests of Internet users.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Google Remarketing sets a cookie on the information technology system of the Data Subject. The definition of cookies is explained 
                    above. With the setting of the cookie, Google enables a recognition of the visitor of our website if he calls up consecutive web 
                    pages, which are also a member of the Google advertising network. With each call-up to an Internet site on which the service has 
                    been integrated by Google Remarketing, the web browser of the Data Subject identifies automatically with Google. During the course 
                    of this technical procedure, Google receives personal information, such as the IP address or the surfing behaviour of the user, 
                    which Google uses, inter alia, for the insertion of interest relevant advertising.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The cookie is used to store personal information, e.g. the Internet pages visited by the Data Subject. Each time we visit 
                    our Internet pages, Personal Data, including the IP address of the Internet access used by the Data Subject, is transmitted to 
                    Google in the United States of America. These Personal Data are stored by Google in the United States of America. Google may 
                    pass these Personal Data collected through the technical procedure to third parties.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Data Subject may, as stated above, prevent the setting of cookies through our website at any time by means of a corresponding 
                    adjustment of the web browser used and thus permanently deny the setting of cookies. Such an adjustment to the Internet browser 
                    used would also prevent Google from setting a cookie on the information technology system of the Data Subject. In addition, 
                    cookies already in use by Google may be deleted at any time via a web browser or other software programs.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In addition, the Data Subject has the possibility of objecting to the interest-based advertising by Google. For this purpose, 
                    the Data Subject must call up the link to www.google.de/settings/ads and make the desired settings on each Internet browser 
                    used by the Data Subject.

                <p>
                    With each call-up to one of the individual pages of this website, which is operated by the Controller and on which a 
                    Google+ button has been integrated, the Internet browser on the information technology system of the Data Subject 
                    automatically downloads a display of the corresponding Google+ button of Google through the respective Google+ button 
                    component. During the course of this technical procedure, Google is made aware of what specific sub-page of our website 
                    was visited by the Data Subject. More detailed information about Google+ is available under 
                    <a href="https://developers.google.com/+/" target="blank">https://developers.google.com/+/</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If the Data Subject is logged in at the same time to Google+, Google recognises with each call-up to our website by the
                    Data Subject and for the entire duration of his or her stay on our Internet site, which specific sub-pages of our Internet
                    page were visited by the Data Subject. This information is collected through the Google+ button and Google matches this 
                    with the respective Google+ account associated with the Data Subject.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If the Data Subject clicks on the Google+ button integrated on our website and thus gives a Google+ 1 recommendation, 
                    then Google assigns this information to the personal Google+ user account of the Data Subject and stores the Personal 
                    Data. Google stores the Google+ 1 recommendation of the Data Subject, making it publicly available in accordance with 
                    the terms and conditions accepted by the Data Subject in this regard. Subsequently, a Google+ 1 recommendation given 
                    by the Data Subject on this website together with other Personal Data, such as the Google+ account name used by the 
                    Data Subject and the stored photo, is stored and processed on other Google services, such as search-engine results of 
                    the Google search engine, the Google account of the Data Subject or in other places, e.g. on Internet pages, or in 
                    relation to advertisements. Google is also able to link the visit to this website with other Personal Data stored on 
                    Google. Google further records this personal information with the purpose of improving or optimising the various Google services.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Through the Google+ button, Google receives information that the Data Subject visited our website, if the Data Subject 
                    at the time of the call-up to our website is logged in to Google+. This occurs regardless of whether the Data Subject 
                    clicks or doesn’t click on the Google+ button.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If the Data Subject does not wish to transmit Personal Data to Google, he or she may prevent such transmission by 
                    logging out of his Google+ account before calling up our website.

                    18:  Data Protection Provisions About the Application and Use of Google-AdWords
                </h3>
                </p>
                <p>
                    On this website, the Controller has integrated Google AdWords. Google AdWords is a service for Internet advertising 
                    that allows the advertiser to place ads in Google search engine results and the Google advertising network. Google 
                    AdWords allows an advertiser to pre-define specific keywords with the help of which an ad on Google's search results 
                    only then displayed, when the user utilises the search engine to retrieve a keyword-relevant search result. In the 
                    Google Advertising Network, the ads are distributed on relevant web pages using an automatic algorithm, taking into 
                    account the previously defined keywords.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The operating company of Google AdWords is Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheatre Pkwy, Mountain View, CA 94043-1351, UNITED STATES.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The purpose of Google AdWords is the promotion of our website by the inclusion of relevant advertising on the 
                    websites of third parties and in the search engine results of the search engine Google and an insertion of 
                    third-party advertising on our website.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If a Data Subject reaches our website via a Google ad, a conversion cookie is filed on the information 
                    technology system of the Data Subject through Google. The definition of cookies is explained above. A 
                    conversion cookie loses its validity after 30 days and is not used to identify the Data Subject. If the 
                    cookie has not expired, the conversion cookie is used to check whether certain sub-pages, e.g. the shopping 
                    cart from an online shop system, were called up on our website. Through the conversion cookie, both Google 
                    and the Controller can understand whether a person who reached an AdWords ad on our website generated sales, 
                    that is, executed or cancelled a sale of goods.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The data and information collected through the use of the conversion cookie is used by Google to create visit 
                    statistics for our website. These visit statistics are used in order to determine the total number of users who 
                    have been served through AdWords ads to ascertain the success or failure of each AdWords ad and to optimise our 
                    AdWords ads in the future. Neither our company nor other Google AdWords advertisers receive information from Google 
                    that could identify the Data Subject.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The conversion cookie stores personal information, e.g. the Internet pages visited by the Data Subject. Each time 
                    we visit our Internet pages, Personal Data, including the IP address of the Internet access used by the Data Subject, 
                    is transmitted to Google in the United States of America. These Personal Data are stored by Google in the United States 
                    of America. Google may pass these Personal Data collected through the technical procedure to third parties.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Data Subject may, at any time, prevent the setting of cookies by our website, as stated above, by means of a 
                    corresponding setting of the Internet browser used and thus permanently deny the setting of cookies. Such a setting 
                    of the Internet browser used would also prevent Google from placing a conversion cookie on the information technology 
                    system of the Data Subject. In addition, a cookie set by Google AdWords may be deleted at any time via the Internet 
                    browser or other software programs.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Data Subject has a possibility of objecting to the interest-based advertisement of Google. Therefore, the Data 
                    Subject must access from each of the browsers in use the link www.google.de/settings/ads and set the desired settings.

                    On this website, the Controller has integrated components of Twitter. Twitter is a multilingual, publicly-accessible 
                    micro-blogging service on which users may publish and spread so-called ‘tweets,’ e.g. short messages, which are limited 
                    to 140 characters. These short messages are available for everyone, including those who are not logged on to Twitter. 
                    The tweets are also displayed to so-called followers of the respective user. Followers are other Twitter users who
                    follow a user's tweets. Furthermore, Twitter allows you to address a wide audience via hashtags, links or retweets.
                </p>

                    The operating company of Twitter is Twitter, Inc., 1355 Market Street, Suite 900, San Francisco, CA 94103, UNITED STATES.

                <p>
                    With each call-up to one of the individual pages of this Internet site, which is operated by the Controller and on 
                    which a Twitter component (Twitter button) was integrated, the Internet browser on the information technology system 
                    of the Data Subject is automatically prompted to download a display of the corresponding Twitter component of Twitter. 
                    Further information about the Twitter buttons is available under 
                    <a href="https://about.twitter.com/de/resources/buttons"  target="blank">https://about.twitter.com/de/resources/buttons</a>. During 
                    the course of this technical procedure, Twitter gains knowledge of what specific sub-page of our website was visited by 
                    the Data Subject. The purpose of the integration of the Twitter component is a re-transmission of the contents of this 
                    website to allow our users to introduce this web page to the digital world and increase our visitor numbers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If the Data Subject is logged in at the same time on Twitter, Twitter detects with every call-up to our website by the 
                    Data Subject and for the entire duration of their stay on our Internet site which specific sub-page of our Internet 
                    page was visited by the Data Subject. This information is collected through the Twitter component and associated with 
                    the respective Twitter account of the Data Subject. If the Data Subject clicks on one of the Twitter buttons integrated 
                    on our website, then Twitter assigns this information to the personal Twitter user account of the Data Subject and 
                    stores the Personal Data.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Twitter receives information via the Twitter component that the Data Subject has visited our website, provided that the 
                    Data Subject is logged in on Twitter at the time of the call-up to our website. This occurs regardless of whether the 
                    person clicks on the Twitter component or not. If such a transmission of information to Twitter is not desirable for 
                    the Data Subject, then he or she may prevent this by logging off from their Twitter account before a call-up to our 
                    website is made.

                    24:  Payment Method: Data Protection Provisions About the Use of PayPal as a Payment Processor
                </h3>
                <p>
                    On this website, the Controller has integrated components of PayPal. PayPal is an online payment service provider. 
                    Payments are processed via so-called PayPal accounts, which represent virtual private or business accounts. PayPal 
                    is also able to process virtual payments through credit cards when a user does not have a PayPal account. A PayPal 
                    account is managed via an e-mail address, which is why there are no classic account numbers. PayPal makes it possible 
                    to trigger online payments to third parties or to receive payments. PayPal also accepts trustee functions and offers 
                    buyer protection services.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The European operating company of PayPal is PayPal (Europe) S.à.r.l. & Cie. S.C.A., 22-24 Boulevard Royal, 2449 Luxembourg, Luxembourg.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If the Data Subject chooses "PayPal" as the payment option in the online shop during the ordering process, we 
                    automatically transmit the data of the Data Subject to PayPal. By selecting this payment option, the Data Subject agrees 
                    to the transfer of Personal Data required for payment processing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Personal Data transmitted to PayPal is usually first name, last name, address, email address, IP address, telephone 
                    number, mobile phone number, or other data necessary for payment processing. The processing of the purchase contract also 
                    requires such Personal Data, which are in connection with the respective order.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The transmission of the data is aimed at payment processing and fraud prevention. The Controller will transfer Personal 
                    Data to PayPal, in particular, if a legitimate interest in the transmission is given. The Personal Data exchanged between 
                    PayPal and the Controller for the processing of the data will be transmitted by PayPal to economic credit agencies. This 
                    transmission is intended for identity and creditworthiness checks.
                </p>
                <p>
                    PayPal will, if necessary, pass on Personal Data to affiliates and service providers or subcontractors to the extent that 
                    this is necessary to fulfil contractual obligations or for data to be processed in the order.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Data Subject has the possibility to revoke consent for the handling of Personal Data at any time from PayPal. A 
                    revocation shall not have any effect on Personal Data which must be processed, used or transmitted in accordance with 
                    (contractual) payment processing.

                    25:  Legal Basis for the Processing
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Art. 6(1) lit. a GDPR serves as the legal basis for processing operations for which we obtain consent for a specific 
                    processing purpose. If the processing of Personal Data is necessary for the performance of a contract to which the 
                    Data Subject is party, as is the case, for example, when processing operations are necessary for the supply of goods 
                    or to provide any other service, the processing is based on Article 6(1) lit. b GDPR. The same applies to such 
                    processing operations which are necessary for carrying out pre-contractual measures, for example in the case of 
                    inquiries concerning our products or services. Is our company subject to a legal obligation by which processing 
                    of Personal Data is required, such as for the fulfilment of tax obligations, the processing is based on Art. 6(1) lit. c GDPR.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In rare cases, the processing of Personal Data may be necessary to protect the vital interests of the Data Subject 
                    or of another natural person. This would be the case, for example, if a visitor were injured in our company and his 
                    name, age, health insurance data or other vital information would have to be passed on to a doctor, hospital or other 
                    third party. Then the processing would be based on Art. 6(1) lit. d GDPR.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Finally, processing operations could be based on Article 6(1) lit. f GDPR. This legal basis is used for processing operations 
                    which are not covered by any of the above mentioned legal grounds, if processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate 
                    interests pursued by our company or by a third party, except where such interests are overridden by the interests or fundamental 
                    rights and freedoms of the Data Subject which require protection of Personal Data. Such processing operations are particularly 
                    permissible because they have been specifically mentioned by the European legislator. He considered that a legitimate interest 
                    could be assumed if the Data Subject is a client of the Controller (Recital 47 Sentence 2 GDPR).

                <p>
                    Where the processing of Personal Data is based on Article 6(1) lit. f GDPR our legitimate interest is to carry out our business in 
                    favour of the well-being of all our employees and the shareholders.

                <p>
                    The criteria used to determine the period of storage of Personal Data is the respective statutory retention period. After expiration 
                    of that period, the corresponding data is routinely deleted, as long as it is no longer necessary for the fulfilment of the contract 
                    or the initiation of a contract.

                    Obligation of the Data Subject to Provide the Personal Data; Possible Consequences of Failure to Provide Such Data
                </h3>
                <p>
                    We clarify that the provision of Personal Data is partly required by law (e.g. tax regulations) or can also result from 
                    contractual provisions (e.g. information on the contractual partner). Sometimes it may be necessary to conclude a contract 
                    that the Data Subject provides us with Personal Data, which must subsequently be processed by us. The Data Subject is, for 
                    example, obliged to provide us with Personal Data when our company signs a contract with him or her. The non-provision of 
                    the Personal Data would have the consequence that the contract with the Data Subject could not be concluded. Before Personal
                    Data is provided by the Data Subject, the Data Subject must contact our Data Protection Officer. Our Data Protection Officer
                    clarifies to the Data Subject whether the provision of the Personal Data is required by law or contract or is necessary for 
                    the conclusion of the contract, whether there is an obligation to provide the Personal Data and the consequences of 
                    non-provision of the Personal Data.

                    As a responsible company, we do not use automatic decision-making or profiling.
