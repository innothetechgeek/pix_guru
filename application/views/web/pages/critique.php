								<p>
								People are under the impression that ‘critique’ means to ‘find fault with’ …… no, not at all.  
								What it means is to analyze and react to something in a positive way (in this instance a photo) to enable the person (the photographer) who is receiving the critique to reach the next level of his/her art.
								Critique comes from the Greek word KRITIKOS – it means to ‘judge’ and is perceived as constructive feedback.
								Criticism is a more negative (hateful) term and is experienced in a more negative way.
								Be prepared to accept the critique/feedback on your photos, as it is meant to help you reach the next level of your photography!

									Personal bias will not influence the feedback we give on your photos. Our feedback will give direction to you – so you will know what to try or do the next time you go out to take photos.  And hopefully our feedback will give direction to you to better your photography skills and to also understand photography better.

									Some are more experienced photographers, but feedback will be in such a way that it is understandable to beginners and advanced photographers.  We will explain why it will be helpful to follow certain techniques or composition ‘rules’  to allow you to achieve better end results and also improve your workflow and photography. You will understand why certain techniques work better at certain times.

									Feedback will be in such a way that it will not alter the story you are telling, but rather allow you to enhance it next time you go out for a shoot.  This is why we are requesting certain information about the photos you are submitting before we can start with the feedback process.  We will never just say: “I don’t like this photo’ or ‘It is a nice photo’–  statements like this is worthless if we do not state WHY THE PHOTO IS NICE/BEAUTIFUL/NOT WORKING etc.

									You will get as much out of this process as you put in – answer the first part of our feedback form to give us enough information to be in a position to give honest feedback.
									By being made aware of all the different critique aspects, will give you some things to think about when you take your next photo.
