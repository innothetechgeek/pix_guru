    			<h3>REFUND POLICY</h3>
    			<br>


                <p>
                    Our policy lasts 30 days. If 30 days have gone by since you submitted photos, unfortunately we can't offer you a refund.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To complete your refund, we require a receipt or proof of deposit/payment (POP).
                </p>
                <p>
                    There are certain situations where only partial refunds are granted: (if applicable):
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Where you already have received feedback on your photo/s submitted</li>
                    <li>Any claim later than 30 days after photo/s submitted for feedback</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <p>
                    We will notify you of the approval or rejection of your refund. If you are approved, then your refund will be processed, 
                    and a credit will automatically be applied to your original method of payment, within 20 days.
                </p>

                    Late or missing refunds (if applicable)
                </h5>
                <p>
                    If you haven't received a refund yet, first check your bank <span style="text-decoration: underline">account</span> again -  it may take some time before your refund 
                    is officially posted. Next, contact your <span style="text-decoration: underline">bank</span>. There is often some processing time before a refund is posted. If you've 
                    done all of this and you still have not received your refund yet, please contact us at <a href="admin@pix-guru.com">admin@pix-guru.com</a>.
